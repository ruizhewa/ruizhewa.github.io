Hello there! I'm Ruizhe (Richard) Wang, a passionate researcher and entrepreneur in the captivating realms of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.

With a B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, an M.S. degree from Caltech, and a Ph.D. degree from USC, I have dedicated my academic journey to developing algorithms that digitally capture and model the intricacies of human visual appearance.

Currently, my research interests have expanded to the exciting area of AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) with a focus on Generative Models, Neural Rendering, and Large Language Models. I am captivated by the potential of AIGC to unlock human creativity with the power of AI algorithms, enabling us to explore new frontiers of artistic expression. Moreover, I believe that these cutting-edge fields will revolutionize how we interpret, generate, and manipulate complex visual data, paving the way for realistic synthesis and interactive experiences.

When I'm not engrossed in research, you can find me shooting hoops on the basketball court, immersing myself in the serenity of nature while hiking, or enjoying delightful moments with my furry friend.

I'm always eager to collaborate and exchange ideas with fellow researchers, visionaries, and entrepreneurs who share my passion. Whether my past experiences or ideas have sparked your curiosity or you simply want to connect, I am excited to explore the possibilities together. Don't hesitate to reach out via email, and let's embark on this thrilling journey of innovation, research, and entrepreneurial exploration together.
